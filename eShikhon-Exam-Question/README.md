## Exam - 01 

### Section 1: Python Try and Catch

Please complete the following tasks using Python's try and catch (exception handling) statements.

1. Write a function called "divide" that takes two parameters, "numerator" and "denominator", and returns the result of the division. In the function, use a try-except block to handle the possibility of a division by zero. If a division by zero occurs, return a string that says "Cannot divide by zero".

2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter two numbers, and then uses the "divide" function from Task 1 to divide the first number by the second number. If the division is successful, print the result. If a division by zero occurs, catch the exception and print the error message.

### Section 2: Python Module and Package

Please complete the following tasks using Python's module and package system.

1. Create a Python package called "math_ops". Inside the package, create a module called "basic_ops" that defines functions for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Create another module called "advanced_ops" that defines functions for advanced operations (exponents, logarithms, and square roots).

2. Write a program that imports the "basic_ops" module from the "math_ops" package and uses the functions to perform some basic arithmetic operations (e.g., add two numbers, multiply two numbers).

3. Write a program that imports the "advanced_ops" module from the "math_ops" package and uses the functions to perform some advanced arithmetic operations (e.g., calculate the logarithm of a number).

W4. rite a program that imports both the "basic_ops" and "advanced_ops" modules from the "math_ops" package and uses the functions to perform a variety of arithmetic operations.

Note: Please provide comments in your code to explain your logic.
